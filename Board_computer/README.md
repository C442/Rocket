##The Board Computer

The Board computer (bc) will be the main brain of the rocket, situated below the flywheel. 
There will be 2 big parts:
** The camera stream
** TVC System

The main job of the raspberrypi will be to save a vidstream via shellscript. I will probably include some buttons or sth else to activate/deactivate it. The raspy will for sure be using a buzzer as a form of feedback. The LED proved to be the wrong choice in many ways the last time.
